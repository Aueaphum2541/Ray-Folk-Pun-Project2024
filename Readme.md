## Objectives
1. **Enhance User Independence:**
   - **Objective:** Improve the self-reliance of wheelchair users by providing a comprehensive evaluation system.
   - **Key Results:** Users should be able to assess their wheelchair usage abilities independently.

2. **Facilitate Proper Wheelchair Selection:**
   - **Objective:** Assist users in selecting the most suitable wheelchair based on their physical abilities and preferences.
   - **Key Results:** Provide personalized recommendations for wheelchair types that align with the user's physical fitness.

3. **Ensure Mobility and Health:**
   - **Objective:** Minimize mobility barriers and promote the overall physical health of wheelchair users.
   - **Key Results:** Evaluate and enhance the efficiency of wheelchair usage to prevent negative impacts on physical health.

4. **Utilize IMU Technology:**
   - **Objective:** Incorporate Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) technology for accurate and real-time movement data collection.
   - **Key Results:** Enable precise tracking of wheelchair movements, contributing to the evaluation process.

5. **Create User-Friendly GUI:**
   - **Objective:** Develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is easy to use and understand, catering to both wheelchair users and physical therapists.
   - **Key Results:** Ensure information received from IMU sensors is displayed in a user-friendly format for effective evaluation.


## Stakeholder
1. Matsunaga Wheelchair Company
2. Physical Therapy
3. Wheelchair Coach

**User Stories:**

1. As a **Wheelchair User**, I want to **receive feedback on my wheelchair usage abilities for continuous improvement** so that **I can enhance my skills and overall well-being.**
   - Scenario: **User's Feedback for Improvement**, given **a completed evaluation by a Wheelchair User**, when **the system processes the data, then it generates a summary of the user's performance and suggests areas for improvement**.

2. As a **Wheelchair Coach**, I want to **evaluate the user's strength and mobility to recommend suitable wheelchairs** so that **users can have personalized and comfortable mobility solutions.**
   - Scenario:**Wheelchair Coach's Evaluation**, given **an ongoing evaluation**, when **the system, as requested by a Wheelchair Coach, conducts strength tests, anaerobic performance assessments, and evaluates nimbleness**, then **it processes the data and generates parameters (distance, speed, time) for each test, indicating suitability**.

3. As a **Matsunaga Wheelchair Company**, I want to **enhance the detection of movement within the home of an elderly person using a wheelchair. The emphasis is on collecting long-term data and utilizing indicators of activity type rather than physical performance**. so that **to be ensure accurate and reliable assessment results, fostering user trust in the evaluation outcomes**.
   - Scenario: **Movement Detection and Assessment, given movement data received from IMU sensors during the evaluation**, when **the system processes the data**, then **it generates accurate and reliable evaluation results, ensuring the maximum error percentage for distance and time measurements is within acceptable limits. The focus is on capturing long-term data and distinguishing between various types of activities to provide a comprehensive understanding of the user's mobility patterns. This approach enhances the overall assessment and promotes trust in the evaluation results among wheelchair users.**
